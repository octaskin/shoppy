shoppy, a simple script as a minimalist replacement for shopping list apps

input format: a single item per line txt file, details can be added trailing with a comma

ordering: edit the store-order.txt file with category names. might sound like a weird feature but try to shop from a huge supermarket, it comes in handy.

config: place a config.py file at $HOME/.config/shoppy/

Config file arguments
    data_dir: str, path to where categories and the input/output lists will be stored.

# TODO: Recurrent mode 
- Add --single mode to only execute a single time otherwise behave as the
  dmenu-bluetooth which re-prompts all the time
- `parser.add_argument( "-s", "--single", action="store_true", help="do not run
  in recurrent mode")`

# TODO: Adding details
- Add ability to add details on prompt
